However, nonadherence to antihyperglycemic medication is common and a clinician could confuse nonadherence with pharmacologic failure, potentially leading to premature prescribing of second line therapies. We sought to measure metformin use prior to second-line therapy initialization. **Research Design and Methods** A retrospective cross-sectional study using un-identifiable member claims data from individuals covered from 2010-2015 by Aetna, a U.S. health benefits company. Beneficiaries with 2 physician claims or one hospitalization with Type 2 DM diagnoses were included. Recommended use of metformin was measured by the proportion of days covered over 60-days. Sensitivity analysis varied estimates of the percentage of beneficiaries using low-cost generic prescription medication programs. **Results** 52,544 individuals had diabetes. Of 22,956 patients given second-line treatment, only 1,875 (8.2%) had evidence of recommended use of metformin in the prior 60 days, and 6,441 (28.0%)  had no prior claims evidence of having taken metformin. At the top range of sensitivity up to only 49.5% patients could have had recommended use. Patients were more likely to be given an additional second-line antihyperglycemic medication or insulin if they were given their initial second-line medication without evidence of recommended use of metformin (P<0.001). **Conclusion** Despite published guidelines, second-line therapy is often initiated without evidence of recommended use of first-line therapy. Apparent treatment failures, which may in fact be attributable to non-adherence to guidelines are common. Point of care and population-level processes are needed to monitor and improve guideline adherence.\"\nabstract_short = \"Despite published guidelines, second-line therapy is often initiated without evidence of recommended use of first-line therapy.
